*The first thing that struck us was how happy, at
ease and comfortable the children are at Kep
Gardens. Janine and Andrew have created a
delightful atmosphere – the resources built up
over time are impressive and the classrooms
bright and colourful. It was wonderful to be able
to contribute.*

*The opportunity to work one-on-one with the
students – from number, colour and image
recognition with the very small children, to
reading through various levels for the primary
children, to conversations with those in classes
7 and 8 - was very special, and lots of fun.
Being able to give intensive individual time to
children to help them practice their English is so
beneficial for their communication skills and
understanding. Some of our favourite moments
were of taking class 8 for conversation and
learning about their lives and what they hope to
do.*

*Anyone choosing to spend some time as a
volunteer at Kep Gardens will have a wonderful
and rewarding time making a real difference to
these lovely young people. You may be in a
gap year or retired, stay for a week or months –
you can be assured of a very warm welcome
from Andrew and Janine and will have a time
you will remember forever.*
