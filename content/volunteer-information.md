# Volunteer Information

Volunteering at Kep Gardens is an educational, fun and valued experience.  Come for a day or for as long as you like.  Our formal programme is structured to allow flexibility as do our accommodation facilities.

Kep Gardens welcomes you into our family.  We are looking forward to your visit.  We have put together a few points for you to understand about our expectations of your volunteer work and the living conditions you will encounter. 

Our English school has been running since 2008.  We run a 45 week curriculum that concentrates on the correct pronunciation, grammar, reading and conversation for English.  We hold 16 classes each day from Monday to Friday.  Students’ ages range from 6 –18 years old.  Class sizes are 25 for younger classes and up to 30 students in the older classes.  We also have a Playgroup and Kindergarten each morning, ages ranging from 3 – 5.  Life skills also play a very important part in our curriculum. 

- Our Child Protection Policy requires a recent police report.
- Volunteers are asked to choose which sessions they would like to work:  8.00-10.00 am young children; 2.00-5.00 pm primary school children; 5.15-8.15 pm high school students, five days a week, but should allow additional time for preparation if teaching in the classroom.
- The majority of the volunteer work is a one-on-basis which gives volunteers a chance to chat and get to know students individually.
- From Monday to Friday we ask you to dress appropriately for a school environment.  Please respect the Cambodian culture and dress conservatively and modestly.
- Please ensure you are never alone with a student and can be openly seen at all times.
- Kep Gardens is a non-government organization with no religious or political affiliations.  Please do not discuss your religious or political beliefs with the students.
- Please don’t show favourites.  All Kep Gardens students are treated equally.
- Volunteers must have a good command of the English language and be able to follow a set curriculum. We have very structured rules and regulations for the good of the school – volunteers must abide by these.

### Handy Tips
- Don’t pat anyone on the head.  This is offensive to Buddhists.
- Don’t touch a monk.  We sometimes have monks in our classes.
- To open your mind to learning about Cambodian culture, spend some spare time interacting with the students and staff at Kep Gardens.  You will go home a richer person with a warm feeling in your heart.
- Villagers dress traditionally and conservatively, and though they will expect foreigners to dress differently, you will get stared at if you wear “short” shorts (knee length is fine) and strappy tops. Bring hats to wear during the day but never wear them inside or in a pagoda.

### Weekends and Spare time Activities
- Kep Gardens is situated at the northern entrance to the Kep National Park.
- We conduct village tours and local pagoda visits and request a small donation of $2.
- The town of Kep is 10 kms away, Rabbit Island is off the coast of Kep and Kampot is 20 kms away, all of which are ideal weekend getaways.
- Volunteers may like to visit the national park, pepper plantations and caves which are only a tuktuk ride away.
- Tuktuk hire can be arranged.
- Hire of a motorcycle can be arranged.
