Kep Gardens was established in 2007.

The vision of Kep Gardens was born in December,
2006 after a holiday in Cambodia and has grown
from there.
We were impressed by the
overwhelming friendliness and determination of
the people despite their long and violent history
that resulted in their poor socio and economic
conditions, particularly in the rural communities.
We had been seeking avenues to contribute in a
valuable and meaningful way to society in the later
years of our life that could be achievable with
limited monetary resources. What started out as
a holiday has turned into a determination to help
make a brighter future for the children and youth
in a small, Cambodian, rural community.
