    VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE
</h1> <p>The first thing that struck us was how happy, at
ease and comfortable the children are at Kep
Gardens. Janine and Andrew have created a
delightful atmosphere – the resources built up
over time are impressive and the classrooms
bright and colourful. It was wonderful to be able
to contribute.</p>
<p>The opportunity to work one-on-one with the
students – from number, colour and image
recognition with the very small children, to
reading through various levels for the primary
children, to conversations with those in classes
7 and 8 – was very special and lots of fun.
Being able to give intensive individual time to
children to help them practice their English is so
beneficial for their communication skills and
understanding. Some of our favourite moments
were of taking class 8 for conversation and
learning about their lives and what they hope to
do.</p>
<p>Anyone choosing to spend some time as a
volunteer at Kep Gardens will have a wonderful
and rewarding time making a real difference to
these lovely young people. You may be in a
gap year or retired, stay for a week or months –
you can be assured of a very warm welcome
from Andrew and Janine and will have a time
you will remember forever.</p>
<p><em>Helen and Becca</em></p>
<p>Volunteering at Kep Gardens is an
educational, fun and valued experience.
Come for a day or for as long as you like. Our
formal programme is structured to allow
flexibility as do our accommodation facilities.</p>
<p>Kep Gardens welcomes you into our family.
We are looking forward to your visit. We have
put together a few points for you to
understand about our expectations of your
volunteer work and the living conditions you
will encounter.</p>
<p>Our English school has been running since
2008. We run a 45 week curriculum that
concentrates on the correct pronunciation,
grammar, reading and conversation for
English. We hold 16 classes each day from
Monday to Friday. Students’ ages range from
6 –18 years old. Class sizes are 25 for
younger classes and up to 30 students in the
older classes. We also have a Playgroup and
Kindergarten each morning, ages ranging
from 3 – 5. Life skills also play a very ?????</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Child Protection Policy requires a
recent police report.</li>
<li>Volunteers are asked to choose which
sessions they would like to work: 8.00-
10.00 am young children; 2.00-5.00 pm
primary school children; 5.15-8.15 pm high
school students, five days a week, but
should allow additional time for preparation
if teaching in the classroom.</li>
<li>The majority of the volunteer work is a one-
on-basis which gives volunteers a chance
to chat and get to know students
individually.</li>
<li>From Monday to Friday we ask you to
dress appropriately for a school
environment. Please respect the
Cambodian culture and dress
conservatively and modestly.</li>
<li>Please ensure you are never alone with a
student and can be openly seen at all
times.</li>
<li>Keo Gardens is a non-government
organization with no religious or political
affiliations. Please do not discuss your
religious or political beliefs with the
students.</li>
<li>Please don’t show favourites. All Kep
Gardens students are treated equally.</li>
<li>Volunteers must have a good command of
the English language and be able to follow
a set curriculum. We have very structured
rules and regulations for the good of the
school – volunteers must abide by these.</li>
</ul>
<p>Handy Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t pat anyone on the head. This is
offensive to Buddhists.</li>
<li>Don’t touch a monk. We sometimes have
monks in our classes.</li>
<li>To open your mind to learning about
Cambodian culture, spend some spare
time interacting with the students and staff
at Kep Gardens. You will go home a richer
person with a warm feeling in your heart.</li>
<li>Villagers dress traditionally and
conservatively, and though they will expect
foreigners to dress differently, you will get
stared at if you wear “short” shorts (knee
length is fine) and strappy tops. Bring hats
to wear during the day but never wear
them inside or in a pagoda.
Volunteer Accommodation and
Facilities</li>
<li>A donation of $5 per day per room applies.
If you stay elsewhere on the weekends, we
will keep your possessions in your
room.</li>
<li>Volunteers stay in a room with an ensuite
bathroom, fan, mosquito net, linen and
towels provided. This room may be shared
depending on the number of volunteers.</li>
<li>A kitchen is available for use. You are
welcome to join staff members for a Khmer
lunch at a cost of $2. Deliveries of evening
meals can be arranged.</li>
<li>A canteen is open during the day for
snacks, noodles and Khmer coffee.
Breakfast is available at the canteen.</li>
<li>Unlimited bottled water is provided in your
room as well as the shed. Please bring
your own bottle for refills.</li>
<li>A laundry service is available at your cost.</li>
<li>The bathroom consists of a sit down toilet
with a Khmer bucket and scoop shower.
No hot water.</li>
<li>Wifi is available.</li>
<li>Insect repellent and sunscreen are must
haves. Also any medications you require.</li>
<li>Please bring a torch/flashlight.</li>
<li>There is a town about 1.5 kms away with a
market and other facilities including a bank
and an ATM.</li>
<li>Other ATMs are available in Kep.</li>
<li>The nearest place for European food, post
office or beach is Kep, approximately 10
kms away. An Italian restaurant has just
opened in the village.
Tuktuk or moto can be arranged at your
expense.</li>
<li>Hire of a motorcycle can be arranged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weekends and Spare time Activities</p>
<ul>
<li>Kep Gardens is situated at the northern
entrance to the Kep National Park.</li>
<li>We conduct village tours and local pagoda
visits and request a small donation of $2.</li>
<li>The town of Kep is 10 kms away, Rabbit
Island is off the coast of Kep and Kampot
is 20 kms away, all of which are ideal
weekend getaways.</li>
<li>Volunteers may like to visit the national
park, pepper plantations and caves which
are only a tuktuk ride away.</li>
<li>Tuktuk hire can be arranged.</li>
<li>Hire of a motorcycle can be arranged.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE FIRST HAND
AND LEARN ABOUT TRADITIONAL
KHMER VILLAGE LIFE?</li>
<li>Village walk and home visit.</li>
<li>Listening to stories told by older people
who survived the Pol Pot regime.</li>
<li>Visit the local Phnom Prous Pagoda.</li>
<li>Presentation by Class 8 on various
Cambodian topics - great public speaking
experience for the students.</li>
<li>Khmer dancing presented by younger and
older groups of students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers 1-3 incur a $2 donation per
person which goes directly to the local
people to thank them for hosting your visit.
Volunteering at Kep Gardens is nothing like a
holiday, but nonetheless a “once-in-a-lifetime”
experience. It’s great to see the dedication
Janine and Andrew have and all the efforts
they put into the English school, the
construction work, and all the other activities Kep
Gardens offers to the Cambodian
community.</p>
<p>Living at Kep Gardens is not always as
comfortable as staying in a guesthouse, but it
does make you feel part of the family.
Kimhean and Vuh are always willing to help
you out with whatever query you may have.</p>
<p>When being part of the Kep Gardens’ project,
you get to learn a lot about the people who call
this part of Cambodia their home. We were
very lucky to be invited for a wedding of an old
Kep Gardens student. We felt very welcome
and it was a pleasure to experience that all the
other Kep Gardens students who were
present, could talk to us in very good English!
They all spoke with great respect and love
about Janine and Andrew.</p>
<p>We will cherish our memories of all the Kep
Gardens’ children we got to teach every day.
The smaller kids really are lots of fun, and it
was very pleasant and interesting to get to
learn more about the lives of the older English
students.</p>
<p>The 6 weeks we spent at Kep Gardens were
fun, challenging, hot, interesting …. all in all a
great experience we for sure will never forget.</p>
